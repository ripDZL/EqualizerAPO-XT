# Skin hooks and the screenshot gallery

Phase 0 of the skin program (issue #66) added two structural hooks to `ISkin`
and an offscreen screenshot gallery. This note is the reference for the Phase 1
skin agents (issue #67) and the Phase 2 integrator (issue #68).

This file covers the *mechanics* (hook contracts, gallery, proof rules). The
*design philosophy* of each skin — what it believes, what it forbids, and how a
new UI element must answer in its language — lives in
[docs/skins/](skins/README.md), one constitution per skin. Read the relevant
constitution before styling anything skin-specific.

## Knob paint hook

`AudioKnob` (`Editor/widgets/AudioKnob.{h,cpp}`, a `QDial`) owns **all input
handling**: rotary drag tracking, wheel, keyboard. Its `paintEvent` only
collects a `KnobState` and delegates painting:

```cpp
// ISkin (Editor/skins/ISkin.h)
virtual void paintKnob(QPainter& painter, const QRect& rect,
	const KnobState& state, const SkinTokens& tokens) const;
```

`KnobState` carries `value/minimum/maximum`, the resolved `ratio` (0..1), a
`bipolar` flag, the optional centred `valueText`, and
`enabled/hovered/dragging/focused`. Notes:

- **Bipolar vs unipolar.** Gain knobs (Preamp card, BiQuad gain dial) set
  `bipolar = true`; frequency and Q dials stay unipolar. A skin must render
  the two kinds distinguishably (e.g. the value arc grows from the centre for
  bipolar knobs).
- **`valueText` may be empty.** Promoted legacy dials (BiQuad, Delay,
  LoudnessCorrection `.ui` files promote `QDial` to `AudioKnob`) display their
  value in a separate spin box and map the dial to log-scaled steps, so
  painting `value` for them is wrong. Only paint a number when `valueText` is
  non-empty, or derive a display value from your own formatting of `ratio`.
- **Geometry.** Promoted legacy dials are 100x66; the card knob is 74x74. Keep
  the knob round by working inside a centred square (see the default
  implementation in `Editor/skins/ISkin.cpp`).
- The default implementation reproduces the pre-hook rendering
  pixel-identically and deliberately ignores the hover/drag/focus flags.

`SkinManager::paintKnob` routes the widget to the active skin; a skin implements
the override on its `ISkin` subclass, which lives in its own translation unit
(`Editor/skins/StudioSkin.cpp` and its four siblings). `Skins.cpp` only holds the
roster lookup - it stopped holding the skin classes when they were split apart.

## Command-row chrome hook

Rows are recreated on every skin/dark switch (`FilterTable::updateGuis()`), so
per-row chrome is built at construction time. `CommandRowInfo`
(`Editor/skins/ISkin.h`) identifies a row: descriptor `type` (`"biquad"`,
`"include"`, `"vst"`, `"copy"`, ...), lower-cased `command`, a `legacyRow`
flag, and `enabled/selected/focused/depth`. Four hooks, all with
appearance-preserving defaults:

- `cardFrameStyle(info, tokens)` / `cardHeaderStyle(info, tokens)` — the
  inline stylesheets for `QFrame#FilterCardRow` and
  `QWidget#FilterCardHeader`, re-evaluated whenever the row's
  selected/focused/enabled state changes. The defaults are the shared
  token-driven strings every skin used before (including the
  `tokens.cardRailWidth` accent rail). Override these to give command types
  their own frame/header treatment.
- `prepareCommandRow(info, card, header, body, tokens)` — called once per
  construction. For modern card rows `card`/`header`/`body` are the
  `CommandRowFrame`, the header strip and the body stack. The Include/VST
  card editors and the legacy Include/VST rows also consult the hook with
  only `body` set (and `legacyRow = true` for the legacy pair). Use it to set
  dynamic properties for QSS or to attach extra chrome widgets. It receives
  the same active `SkinTokens` as the paint/style hooks; do not fetch them
  from `SkinManager` inside the skin implementation.
- `paintCardChrome(painter, rect, info, tokens)` — painted decoration drawn
  by `CommandRowFrame` (`Editor/widgets/CommandRowFrame.{h,cpp}`) after the
  QSS background/border and before child widgets. Use for rails, screws,
  per-type markers that QSS cannot express.
- `typeBadgeStyle(info, typeColor, tokens)` /
  `typeBadgeInk(info, typeColor, badgeToken, tokens)` — the badge pair. The
  style string dresses `QLabel#FilterTypeBadge`; since feedback round 2 the
  badge content is the catalog pictogram
  (`FilterCardModel::badgeIconResource`, English monograms survive only as
  the fallback for unmapped lines), and because a tinted pixmap cannot follow
  the QSS `color` rule, the ink hook restates the same colour the style
  writes for text. Override both together or the glyph and the chip drift
  apart. `badgeToken` is the descriptor monogram (the biquad type code),
  which studio folds onto its band families.

QSS can already target rows per command type without code: the card frame and
header carry dynamic properties `filterKind` (lower-cased command),
`filterEnabled`, `selected`, `focused`, `scopeDepth`.

Scope-gutter paint uses shared geometry from `SkinScopeGutterLayout`
(`Editor/skins/SkinPaint.h`). It classifies If head, ElseIf/Else branch,
EndIf tail and member rows, computes the channel-vs-If rail split, applies
the `logicSiblingsIndentAsMembers` branch/tail mount rule, and exposes shared
rail centers/card edge/junction positions. Skins still own the material
language of the rail; they should not recalculate the row-model geometry.
The same header also owns fixed paint material effects:
`skinMaterialShadow(alpha)` and `skinMaterialHighlight(alpha)`. They mirror QSS
`@SHADOW_Axx@` / `@HIGHLIGHT_Axx@` for bevels, recesses, sheens and lighting
math only; do not use them for semantic text, badges or status colours.
Rack-specific hardware recipes that repeat outside the command-row frame live in
`RackChrome`: `engraveText`, `paintScrew`, boolean `paintLed`, and
the glow/halo overload of `paintLed`, plus `paintBrushing`. Use them only for
Rack widgets with the same physical grammar. For LED variants, keep the
electrical state law, halo radius and receded-off choice explicit at the call
site. For brushing, pass the caller's exact ink and base alpha instead of
hiding those material decisions in the helper.

## List-chrome hooks (add row, insertion seam)

Legacy-cleanup round 3 replaced the green-icon `QToolBar` at the end of the
card list with two skinnable widgets. Both own all input handling (click,
Space/Return, focus, tooltips) and delegate every pixel:

```cpp
// ISkin (Editor/skins/ISkin.h)
virtual void paintAddRow(QPainter&, const QRect&, const ListChromeState&, const SkinTokens&) const;
virtual void paintInsertSeam(QPainter&, const QRect&, const ListChromeState&, const SkinTokens&) const;
```

`AddCardRow` (`Editor/widgets/AddCardRow.{h,cpp}`) is the persistent "add
card" row after the last card; the rect handed to the hook already carries
the cards' 8px column inset. `FilterInsertSeam`
(`Editor/widgets/FilterInsertSeam.{h,cpp}`) floats over the first card's top
margin and only paints while hovered — at rest it must stay invisible, which
is also why adding the hook changed no gallery shot. `ListChromeState`
carries `hovered/pressed/focused` and the widget's translated `label`. The
semantics (header `+` inserts BELOW its card, the seam is the only
front-insertion entry, no per-gap `+` chrome) are the shared insertion
contract in [docs/skins/README.md](skins/README.md); LegacyRows keeps the
frozen toolbar flow.

## GraphicEQ plot hook

The modern GraphicEQ card (`Editor/widgets/cards/GraphicEQCardEditor.{h,cpp}`)
does not reuse the legacy QGraphicsView stack at all. Its response lives in
`GraphicEQPlotWidget` (`Editor/widgets/GraphicEQPlotWidget.{h,cpp}`), which
follows the knob precedent: the widget owns the node model and every input
gesture (drag, double-click insert, Delete, selection, arrow nudges, wheel
dB zoom, right-drag pan; the frequency axis is pinned to 20 Hz – 20 kHz) and
delegates every pixel:

```cpp
// ISkin (Editor/skins/ISkin.h)
virtual void paintGraphicEqPlot(QPainter&, const GraphicEQPlotState&, const SkinTokens&) const;
```

`GraphicEQPlotState` hands the skin pre-mapped pixel geometry: the widget
rect and inner `plotRect`, the sampled response `curve`, `zeroY`,
`nodePositions` with selection/hover/focus indices, labelled grid lines,
`bandLocked` (15/31 layouts, where stems/bars are a legitimate reading) and
the cursor readout text. The default implementation is a quiet token-driven
instrument; each shipped skin overrides it wholesale (form in paint code,
QSS only tints the stock controls around it). Precise entry rides the
selected-band readout strip under the plot — `GraphicEQReadout`,
`GraphicEQBandCaption`, `GraphicEQReadoutLabel`, `GraphicEQFreqBox`/
`GraphicEQGainBox` (X1 value-scrub grammar) — plus `GraphicEQModeCombo`
(X5 paramSelector) and the `GraphicEQActionButton` row above. The frozen
LegacyRows GraphicEQ GUI keeps the original QGraphicsView stack untouched.

## Analysis graph shared geometry

Analysis-style plugin graph painters still own their skin-specific strokes,
fills, labels, and glow/material language. Shared axis/cursor math lives in
`SkinAnalysisGraphLayout` (`Editor/skins/SkinPaint.h`): plot edges, zero-row
clamping, hover clamping, x/y label rectangles, footer rectangles, and
grid-label thinning helpers. New analysis graph paint code should use those
helpers for geometry instead of recalculating label placement per skin.

## Skin theme data for satellite executables

`Editor/skins/SkinThemeData.{h,cpp}` holds the behaviour-free half of the
skin system: id aliases (`resolveId`), the built-in token tables, QSS resource
paths, complete style-sheet loading (`styleSheet`), the `@TOKEN@` /
`@TOKEN_A30@` substitution, unresolved-token reporting, the token → `QPalette`
mapping and the Qt 6.10 combo-arrow override. Alpha sentinels use integer
percent opacity (`@ACCENT_A30@` → `rgba(r, g, b, 0.30)`) so QSS no longer has
to hand-expand token colours for translucent fills. `@SHADOW_Axx@` and
`@HIGHLIGHT_Axx@` are fixed material-effect aliases for black/white alpha fills,
not per-skin palette colours. `styleSheet` is the single app-sheet path:
canonicalize id, load the skin sheet, use the Studio sheet as the missing-QSS
fallback, substitute tokens, append shared widget overrides, and report any
unresolved `@TOKEN@` sentinels. The `ISkin` classes delegate their
`tokens()`/`qssResource()` here, so the tables cannot drift. DeviceSelector
compiles this one unit plus the aliased `.qss`/font resources
(`DeviceSelector/DeviceSelectorSkins.qrc`) and wears the Editor's stored
skin (`interface/skin`, default studio; heritage mode keeps the native
look).

## Reference-card view hook

Rows whose subject is an external file (Include, Convolution,
MultiConvolution, VSTPlugin) render their body through a per-skin view,
following the Copy routing-renderer precedent:

```cpp
// ISkin (Editor/skins/ISkin.h)
virtual ReferenceCardView* createReferenceCardView(const QString& kind, QWidget* parent) const;
```

The host editors (`Editor/widgets/cards/{Include,Convolution,MultiConvolution,VST}CardEditor`)
own all behavior - path resolution, file dialogs, plugin lifecycle, dependency
import - and describe themselves through `ReferenceCardState`
(`Editor/widgets/cards/ReferenceCardView.h`): primary name, as-written
location, missing flag, absolute-path flag, VST2/VST3 format badge, the
impulse-response readout list and one status line. Views print the location
through `ReferenceCardState::locationPrefix()` - the directory closed by its
trailing separator (`Surround\`) - so the folder always reads as what
contains the file; a bare folder name hanging off the name depicted the
containment upside down (matrix's `@ <dir>` marker already states the
location and stays as is). Views own structure and
presentation only; the base class owns the shared inline path-edit mode and
the name-activation plumbing (clicking the name opens the target / plugin
panel). Hosts hand action buttons over with semantic roles
(`addActionButton`) and never lose control of their behavior or visibility;
the Browse button doubles as the "Locate..." recovery entry while the
reference is missing. The default is the neutral
`DefaultReferenceCardView`; the shipped skins override it in
`Editor/skins/cards/<Skin>ReferenceCardView.{h,cpp}`. Paths elide at paint
time (`Editor/widgets/ElidedLabel.h`), never at set time.

## Routing renderer hook

Copy's per-skin routing view generalizes to any command whose body is a
source→target mapping:

```cpp
// ISkin (Editor/skins/ISkin.h) -> IRoutingRenderer (Editor/widgets/routing/IRoutingRenderer.h)
virtual IRoutingRenderer* routingRenderer() const;
RoutingView* IRoutingRenderer::create(assignments, channelNames, portModel, parent);
```

`RoutingPortModel` selects between the two shapes. The default reproduces
Copy: both sides grow from the assignments plus every device channel, and
every connection carries an editable factor. A non-empty
`portModel.fixedSources` puts the view in fixed-source mode: the source side
is exactly that list (MultiConvolution passes the IR file's channels,
`"0".."N-1"`), no other source is offered, sources keep the solid port
styling (they are ports, not virtual channels), and `allowFactors == false`
reduces interaction to connect/disconnect (no gain labels, captions or
editors; a double-click on a chip/pill removes it where the grid views
toggle by click). The MultiConvolution card
(`Editor/widgets/cards/MultiConvolutionCardEditor`) hosts the view under its
reference card with a `Channel mapping` caption strip
(`#MultiConvolutionMappingCaption` / `#MultiConvolutionMappingHint` in every
skin's QSS) and a `+` entry that adds output channels (a new name becomes a
virtual channel, like Copy). Data rides
`Editor/widgets/routing/MultiConvolutionRoutingAdapter` both ways; without a
readable IR file the card shows the hint instead of a view, because the
simple form ("every file channel") has no known expansion to edit.

## Screenshot gallery

The Editor has a headless gallery mode used to prove appearance-preserving
changes and to produce judging material:

```powershell
$env:QT_QPA_PLATFORM = "offscreen"
# Qt bin + fftw/libsndfile DLL directories must be on PATH; velopack_libc.dll
# must sit next to Editor.exe (copy deps\velopack_libc\lib\velopack_libc_win_x64_msvc.dll).
# If windeployqt has run on the build dir, the deployed app dir only carries
# the qwindows platform plugin and the offscreen platform fails to load. Point
# Qt at the full plugin tree in that case:
#   $env:QT_PLUGIN_PATH = "<QT_ROOT>\plugins"
.\build-Editor-x64\release\Editor.exe --skin-gallery <outDir> [--skin-gallery-skins studio,rack]
```

For every skin × {dark, light} it renders 29 representative rows — a
parametric filter (`Filter 1: ON PK ...`), a high-shelf with its three knobs,
a peaking filter at 0 dB (bipolar gain at its neutral detent), a `Preamp:`
row (the bare knob + value scrub pair — the row that shows whether a skin
seats custom widgets directly on its surface), an `Include:`
row (resolved), a nested `Include: Surround\...` row (the location line), a
missing `Include:` row (the broken-reference transition with the Locate
entry), a `VSTPlugin:` row (unresolvable library - the missing/named-device
state), two `Device:` rows over four synthetic endpoints (a named selection —
engaged playback switch + engaged capture well beside an idle endpoint, with
the APO-less endpoint behind the reveal toggle — and the `all` master over
powered-down chips), a `Channel:` row, a comment row (`# ...`, the note
card), a `Stage:` row (the two-lane stage card: a captioned Playback lane
with the pre-mix → post-mix chain, and a Recording lane holding capture), an
empty `Copy:` row, a
populated `Copy:` row (mixed factors and a virtual target — the routing
views' judged scene), a `Convolution:` row, two `MultiConvolution:` rows
(populated and freshly inserted empty), a `GraphicEQ:` row (the modern
GraphicEQ card — the clean-install first impression), `Filter:` rows for
dynamic preamp, all-pass, notch, IIR, and Hilbert, three `Velvet:` rows
(static, dynamic, and invalid), and two raw-text rows (a bare note line and
an `If:` command, the TXT presentation) — in three
states: `normal`, `hover` (hover-equivalent via `Qt::WA_UnderMouse`), and
`disabled` (the line commented out, which is the product's real disabled
state). The reference rows resolve against synthetic target files the gallery
writes under `<outDir>/refs/` (`example.txt`, a 100 ms mono `example.wav`, a
100 ms 4-channel `brir.wav`), so the healthy cards render deterministic
readouts; the gallery also sets `EAPO_SKIN_GALLERY=1`, which the card editors
honour by skipping the audio-service ACL probe (scratch files have no
meaningful ACL story). The filter picker is captured in three states
(`normal`, `hover`, `empty`; pickers that do not implement
`FilterPickerView::galleryShowcase` repeat their normal look), plus one shot
each for the toolbar, title bar, menu bar and an open menu, two for the
add-card row (`addrow` normal/hover), one for the insertion seam's hover
reveal (`seam`) and one for the update toast (`toast`). Output names are
stable: `<skin>_<dark|light>_<row>_<state>.png`,
10 × 2 × 118 = 2360 PNGs
for a full run; the run self-checks the count, so adding a gallery row needs
no external count update. A row shot fails the render (non-zero exit) if a
visible horizontal scrollbar is found inside the row — rows must fit the
960px gallery viewport in every skin. Exit code 0 means every PNG was
written; unknown skin ids fail loudly instead of falling back to studio.

CI runs the gallery on the primary x64-avx2 variant and uploads the PNGs as
the `skin-gallery` artifact, so a PR's visual state can be reviewed without a
local build.

Determinism notes: the gallery runs before translators load (English strings),
applies each skin itself (`SkinManager::applySkin` swaps the stylesheet and
derives the palette), and renders at device pixel ratio 1 on the
offscreen platform. PNGs from the same machine and build are byte-stable, so
`Get-FileHash` comparisons prove pixel identity; PNGs from different machines
may differ slightly in font rasterization.

## Lane geometry and tick label boxes

`CommandRowInfo` carries the row's lane geometry: `laneUnit` (one indent band),
`laneCount` (how many bands are drawn left of the card face), `cardLeft`, and
`laneCenter(level)`. `paintScopeGutter` paints in that space, so a skin answers
what a lane looks like and never recomputes where it is. The rule that a branch or
tail row mounts one unit deeper than its head is already folded into `laneCount`,
because the same call sets the row widget's own left margin - a gutter can no
longer disagree with the card face beside it.

`skinXTickLabelRect` / `skinYTickLabelRect` in `SkinPaint.h` build a tick label
box centred on a grid line. The y variant keeps its inset and width as arguments:
the skins use 4, 5, 6 and 8 px and nobody decided they should differ, but nobody
decided they should agree either, so settling it is a skin round's call rather
than a refactor's.

Colour tokens answer to an `@TOKEN_RGB@` form as well as `@TOKEN@`, expanding to
the three channels so a sheet can write `rgba(@ACCENT_RGB@, 0.30)`. QSS has no
variables and its `rgba()` wants numbers, so this is the only way a sheet holds a
token at partial alpha instead of writing the palette value out by hand.

`prepareCommandRow` receives `SkinTokens` like every other hook. It was the one
that did not, and all shipped skins reached for `SkinManager::instance()->tokens()`
inside it instead.

## Custom Theme Lab themes

Saved Theme Lab themes live in the Editor settings under
`interface/customThemes`. Their active skin id is `custom:<id>`, while
`baseTheme` chooses the shipped QSS/paint grammar and the saved colour map
overrides token values before `finishTokens()` derives the secondary colours.

`Editor/skins/CustomThemeStore.*` owns the storage, JSON import/export shape, id
normalization, and token construction. The Editor and Device Selector both read
that store, so a custom theme selected in the Editor also dresses Device Selector.
New custom themes appear in the Interface menu after the next Editor startup.

## Shipped token-variant themes

Token variants are first-class roster entries in `SkinThemeData`, but they reuse
an existing QSS and painter grammar instead of adding another skin class. That is
intentional: a palette can get the texture of Studio glass, Soft velvet, Rack
brushed metal, Matrix rails, or Minimal precision without duplicating the widget
grammar.

- `midnight` / `obsidian` use Studio glass.
- `arctic` / `aurora` use Soft Lab shadows.
- `ember` / `forge` use Hardware Rack brushing and LEDs.
- `violet` / `nebula` use Signal Matrix rails and grid language.
- `solar` / `noir` use Precision Minimal chrome.

The second-wave dark variants also adjust material tokens, not just colour:
Obsidian rounds Studio glass chrome, Aurora deepens the Soft radius/spacing,
Forge tightens Rack metal, Nebula thickens Matrix rails, and Noir keeps a compact
striped precision layout.

## Adding a skin

Six files, and the first one is the only list of which skins exist.

1. **`Editor/skins/SkinThemeData.cpp`** — add an entry to `roster()`: the id as it
   will be stored in the registry, the base name of its `.qss` pair, and its token
   function. Everything derived from the roster follows automatically: the Editor's
   menu, the token and style-sheet lookups, Device Selector's shot harness, and the
   `testTheSkinRosterIsTheOneList` check.
2. **`Editor/skins/<Name>Skin.cpp`** — the `ISkin` subclass, one translation unit
   per skin, plus its `<name>Skin()` accessor declared in `SkinSupport.h`.
3. **`Editor/skins/Skins.cpp`** — one line in `implementationFor()` mapping the id
   to that accessor. A roster id missing from here is logged and left out of
   `Skins::all()`, rather than silently drawn as Studio.
4. **`Editor/skins/<name>_light.qss` / `<name>_dark.qss`** plus their entries in
   the resource file. Every `@TOKEN@` the sheets use has to be produced by the
   token table, which `testEverySkinSheetResolvesAllThemeTokens` checks.
5. **`Editor/MainWindowParts/MainWindow.Preferences.cpp`** — the translated display
   name, keyed by id. A missing name shows the raw id in the menu.
6. **`DeviceSelector/skins/<Name>DeviceSkin.cpp`** and one line in
   `DeviceSkinPainter::forSkin` — the device dialog's counterpart. Without it that
   dialog draws the new skin as Studio, which is the one place a partial roster is
   still tolerated.

And the constitution: **`docs/skins/<name>.md`** records what the skin is for and
what it must not do. `docs/skins/README.md` says why that document exists before
the code does.

Until this list existed, adding a skin meant editing eighteen places, and missing
one did not fail. `resolveId()` returns `"studio"` for an id it does not know, so a
skin that compiled, registered and appeared in the menu was drawn as Studio with no
error anywhere.
