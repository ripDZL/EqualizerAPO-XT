# ASIO

EqualizerAPO-XT applies the same `config.txt` to ASIO streams. An ASIO
application (a DAW, foobar2000's ASIO output, a game with an ASIO backend)
picks the driver entry `<your driver> (EQ APO XT)` instead of `<your driver>`,
and everything the config says for that device runs on the way to the
hardware and, for inputs, on the way back from it. Nothing else changes: the
same Device Selector installs it, the same Editor edits it, the same file
configures it. The design and its measurements are in
[docs/architecture/asio-host-study.md](../architecture/asio-host-study.md).

## Turning it on

1. Open the Device Selector. Every ASIO driver on the machine appears in the
   playback list and in the capture list, in the same groups as the Windows
   endpoints, as `ASIO <driver name>`; the leading word is the only marker.
2. Tick the playback entry to process what the application sends to the
   interface, the capture entry to process what the interface records, or
   both. Confirm.
3. In the application, choose `<your driver> (EQ APO XT)` as the ASIO driver.
   The original entry stays available and bypasses EqualizerAPO-XT.

The first time the application opens the device, `EqualizerAPOHost.exe`
starts, loads `config.txt`, and only then does the device open: the first
buffer that reaches the hardware is already processed. The host leaves a
minute after the last stream ends.

## Endpoints without an ASIO driver

Any Windows playback or recording endpoint can appear in the ASIO driver
list too: onboard audio, HDMI, a USB DAC or headset that came without an
ASIO driver, a virtual cable. Select the endpoint in the Device Selector,
open the troubleshooting options and tick **Use in ASIO apps**; the entry
is `<device> - <endpoint> (EQ APO XT)`. An
application that picks it opens the endpoint in WASAPI exclusive mode: no
audio engine, no mixing or resampling, the device's own smallest period,
the sample rate the application asks for. The engine host processes the
stream on the way, exactly as for a real ASIO driver, and `config.txt`
sees the stream as the endpoint itself, so `Device: {endpoint GUID}`
matches both the APO and the entry.

This is how a listener who uses exclusive mode keeps the EQ. An APO cannot
reach an exclusive stream (the audio engine is not in its path;
[docs/architecture/wasapi-exclusive-study.md](../architecture/wasapi-exclusive-study.md)),
but a player with an ASIO output can be pointed at the entry instead. A
playback endpoint gives an output-only device, a recording endpoint an
input-only one. The entry belongs to the endpoint's installation: it is
written with the APO and removed with it, and the install report names it.
`DeviceSelector --install-endpoint {guid} --exclusive-mode-eq` does the same from
a terminal.

What the entry offers: buffer sizes in powers of two from the smallest
exclusive period the driver declares (a virtual cable at 48 kHz: 128
frames; a USB DAC with a 3 ms minimum: 256), the sample rates the device
accepts in exclusive mode, and the sample type the device takes there.
Most hardware takes 32-, 24- or 16-bit integers rather than float; the
entry tries the endpoint's own device format first and the wrapper converts
at its edge. The reported latency is two buffers plus the driver's own on
output and one buffer plus the driver's on input. `AsioProbe --target
wasapi:{playback guid}[,{recording guid}]` opens the same target without
any registration, for support sessions and for CI.

The buffer size an application picks is the period the endpoint is asked
for. Two things stand between a small period and a driver keeping it.
The system timer: at its default 15.6 ms resolution a virtual cable
accepted a 5.8 ms period and signalled every 15.9 ms, so the entry asks
Windows for a 1 ms timer while it streams, as DAWs and ASIO drivers do,
and releases it when the stream stops. And the driver's own cycle: some
drivers accept a small period and then signal at their own coarser one
(the same cable: every 10 ms), consuming a whole cycle's worth per
signal, which would leave the rest of each cycle unplayed. The entry
watches the first dozen signals of a stream; when they come well over
the period, it reopens the device side at the smallest multiple of the
application's buffer that covers the cycle and serves that many buffers
per signal, back to back. The application keeps its buffer size, the
audio keeps every sample, and the added latency is reported through
`kAsioLatenciesChanged`. `AsioProbe --target wasapi:{guid} --frames <n>`
shows what a driver did: `event-interval` is its real signal spacing,
`slow-events` how many came late, `bridge` how many buffers each signal
ended up serving (1 on a driver that honours its period).

Measured on the maintainer's VB-CABLE: 128 frames at 48 kHz, 2,256 buffers
in six seconds, none late or missed, and a recording app on the far side
heard the preamp and the peak filter of the test configuration; duplex
(both sides of the cable in one device) and recording-only ran the same
way through the wrapper DLL and the real host. On CI the capture gate
installs the cable's playback endpoint with the entry, activates the
entry's CLSID through COM the way a DAW does, and hears the preamp on the
far side. On x64 builds, endpoint entries are registered for 32-bit hosts as
well; ARM64 ships no 32-bit wrapper.

## What the config sees

An ASIO stream is a device like any other for `Device:` lines. Its string is
`ASIO <driver name> {driver CLSID}`, so `Device: ASIO` selects every ASIO
stream and `Device: Topping` selects one interface. Without a `Device:` line a
filter applies to ASIO streams as well as to endpoints. Channel names follow
the channel count the way they do for endpoints (2 -> `L R`, 6 -> 5.1,
8 -> 7.1, otherwise `1`, `2`, ...); the engine sees every physical channel of
the interface, so `Channel:` names do not move when the application opens
only some of them. `Stage: capture` blocks apply to the input direction,
everything else to the output direction.

The Editor lists an installed ASIO device in its device menu; its toolbar
badge shows the rate and channel count of the last stream once one has run
(the host records them then), and says so when none has.

## Latency and the two modes

By default the wrapper hands each buffer to the host and plays the previous
one: one buffer of extra latency (1.3 ms at 64 frames and 48 kHz), reported
to the application through the driver's latency query, and no dependence on
how quickly the host answers. Measured on a Topping USB Audio Device at 64
frames over ten minutes (450,005 buffers), this mode processed every buffer;
all but three round trips took under 100 microseconds and the worst, 2.5 ms,
was absorbed by the one-buffer pipeline.

The synchronous mode waits for the host inside the buffer callback instead
and adds no latency, but a buffer whose answer misses the deadline passes
through unprocessed. On the same interface a few buffers per minute missed,
from the operating system preempting one of the two threads, so it is not the
default. It can be selected per driver in the Device Selector: select the
driver's entry, open the troubleshooting options and tick **Remove the
buffer**; it applies to both directions. Once ticked, **Wait time** unfolds
beside it: how long a buffer waits for the host before it comes out without
the EQ, up to a quarter of the buffer (the default), half, or three
quarters. A longer wait misses fewer buffers and leaves the application less
of the buffer for its own work. The two remaining options sit side by side
under that row.

## Options in the Device Selector

Besides the synchronous mode and its wait time, an ASIO entry's
troubleshooting panel has two options, both off by default:

- **Start the engine host automatically at boot** writes one `Run` value for
  the machine so the host is up before any application opens the driver.
  Otherwise the first application starts it and it leaves a minute after the
  last one closes the driver. The value stays while any driver asks for it;
  after the option is turned off, a host already running stays until
  sign-out.
- **32-bit host support** also registers the driver entry where 32-bit
  applications look for it (`WOW6432Node`). Unavailable on the ARM64 build,
  which ships no 32-bit wrapper.

The record behind an entry lives under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EqualizerAPO\ASIO\<wrapper CLSID>`: `Mode`,
`DeadlinePercent`, `DeadlineUs` (an explicit microsecond budget, normally 0),
`AutoStart`, `Register32`.

## When something is off

- The application refuses to open the device with a driver error: the host
  could not start or did not load the configuration in time. The reason is
  in `EqualizerAPOAsio.log` and `EqualizerAPOHost.log` under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EqualizerAPO\logs`.
- The interface's sample rate changes while a stream runs: the wrapper asks
  the application to reopen the device, and buffers pass through unprocessed
  until it does.
- The host crashes mid-stream: buffers pass through unprocessed for the rest
  of that session; reopening the device starts a fresh host. The DAW is not
  affected beyond that.
-  32-bit applications see a hardware-driver entry only with **32-bit host
  support** ticked. Endpoint entries register the shipped x86 wrapper
  automatically on x64. Both wrappers talk to the same 64-bit host. The ARM64
  build has no 32-bit wrapper, and its wrapper is ARM64-native: an x64 application running under
  emulation on an ARM64 machine cannot load it (the 64-bit registry view is
  shared, so one entry cannot serve both architectures without an ARM64X
  binary, which this build does not produce).
- DSD streams are not supported; the device refuses to open in a DSD mode.
- An endpoint entry refuses to open with a driver error: another
  application holds the endpoint in exclusive mode, or Windows' exclusive
  mode permission for the device is off (Sound settings, Advanced), or the
  device accepts no exclusive-mode format at the requested rate. The
  message names which; `EqualizerAPOAsio.log` has the HRESULT.

## License

The wrapper is built against the Steinberg ASIO SDK 2.3.4 under the SDK's
GPL version 3 option, so `EqualizerAPOAsio.dll` and the installers that ship
it are distributed under GPL version 3; the text is installed as
`License-gpl-3.0.txt` next to the program. ASIO is a trademark and software
of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.

## What is not covered

The wrapper has been exercised with the fake driver on CI and with a Topping
USB Audio Device on the maintainer's machine. It has not been run under every
DAW; hosts that process outside the buffer callback without calling
`ASIOOutputReady` get their first buffer committed early once, before the
wrapper learns their habit.
