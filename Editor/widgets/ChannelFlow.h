/*
	The channel flow of a config document, walked top-down the way the engine
	walks it: which channel names exist at each line (Copy adds to them) and
	which of them are selected (Channel replaces the selection). Before this
	unit the flow was two shared vectors handed from row widget to row widget,
	each row editing them in place, and the rule for a switched-off line was
	written in two decorators (audit #348 B6). Now the whole flow is computed
	here once, from the lines alone, and each row only reads its own element.

	No Qt on purpose: EditorLogicTests pins the flow directly.
