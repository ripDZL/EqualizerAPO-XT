	The reading rules that pair with SubwooferRoutingUiState's setters: what
	the dialog, the card and the routing adapter show for a state. They used
	to live in three anonymous namespaces, where the dialog and the card read
	"the same" value by different rules (audit #348 B2/TD-36). Widget-free, so
	EditorLogicTests can pin each setter against its reader.
