/*
	This file is part of EqualizerAPO-XT, a system-wide equalizer.

	A skin is a self-contained visual identity. Beyond colour tokens it decides
	which QSS sheet to load and which Copy routing renderer to inject, so that
	each skin can present the same configuration with a genuinely different
	philosophy rather than only different colours. SkinManager owns the active
	ISkin and delegates to it; new skins are added by implementing this
	interface and registering an instance (see Skins.cpp).
