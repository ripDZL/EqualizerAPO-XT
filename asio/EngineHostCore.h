	The engine host's serving loop, free of any process: one stream on the
	calling thread, from waiting for the producer's header to the last
	block. The EqualizerAPOHost.exe runs it on a thread per stream over a
	named ring; the tests and the probe run it on a thread over a heap ring.
	Both call attachAndServe, so the order the product runs is the one the
	tests exercise. Two FilterEngines per stream, one per direction
	(capture = true for the input lane), built by streamEngineSetup exactly
	the way the in-process adapter builds them, so the two adapters hash
	identically.
