	The second kind of target behind the ASIO wrapper
	(docs/architecture/wasapi-exclusive-study.md, section 5): an IASIO that
	opens Windows audio endpoints in WASAPI exclusive mode instead of
	forwarding to a hardware ASIO driver. An application that picks the
	wrapper entry gets what exclusive mode gives it - no engine mixing or
	resampling, the device's own period, the sample rate it asks for - and
	the engine host processes the stream on the way, exactly as for a real
	ASIO target. The wrapper does not know the difference.

	One target holds up to two endpoints of one device: a playback endpoint
	(the ASIO outputs) and a recording endpoint (the ASIO inputs). Both run
	event driven at the ASIO buffer size; when both are present the playback
	stream is the clock and captured packets are queued into the input
	buffers, zero-filled when the recording side has not delivered yet.

	Exclusive mode takes integer containers on most hardware, so the sample
	type reported per channel is whatever the endpoint accepted at the
	current rate, tried in a fixed order from the endpoint's own device
	format. The wrapper converts to float at its edge as it does for any
	driver. Nothing here depends on the Common library: the file compiles
	into the wrapper DLL, the probe and the tests alike.

	The pure parts (container order, buffer-size policy, interleaving, the
	bridge calibration, the capture queue, the output staging and the
	judgement of a device that went away) live in the wasapi namespace so
	the tests can pin them without a device; the stream thread only calls
	COM and hands them the numbers.
