	The registry vocabulary that makes a target driver usable through the
	wrapper: one entry per target under HKLM\SOFTWARE\ASIO (the list every
	DAW reads), its CLSID's InprocServer32 pointing at the wrapper DLL, and
	the same pair in the WOW6432Node views for 32-bit hosts. The wrapper
	CLSID is derived from the target's, so nothing else has to remember the
	pairing. Everything goes through the registry port; the registry's
	64-bit view sees the WOW6432Node keys as ordinary keys, which is why no
	second port is needed.

	Trademark note: the entry name is the target's own name with an
	"(EQ APO XT)" suffix; the wrapper never puts "ASIO" into a product name.
