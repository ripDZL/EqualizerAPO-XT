# EqualizerAPO-XT

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

EqualizerAPO-XT is an active fork of [Equalizer APO 1.4.2](https://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/) for Windows. It keeps Equalizer APO's system-wide audio processing model while modernizing the audio engine, build pipeline, and GUI tools.

This fork builds on earlier double-precision work from [equalizer-apo-64](https://github.com/chebum/equalizer-apo-64) and later SIMD/build work from TheFireKahuna's Equalizer APO forks.

Looking to configure it? The [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/wiki) has installation help and a full [configuration reference](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/wiki/Configuration-reference) for every filter command, in English and Korean.

## Project Status

The original fork goals are complete: the convolution tail bug is fixed, the engine code was refactored and put under regression tests, the Editor UI was rebuilt, SIMD support was consolidated, and releases ship as Velopack packages with automatic updates. The full history since the fork is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Current work areas:

1. Runtime SIMD dispatch in a single binary, replacing the per-variant release channels ([docs/RuntimeDispatchEpic.md](docs/RuntimeDispatchEpic.md)).
2. Acting on findings from the biweekly automated code audit. The deferred
   architecture pass now has an owned update-session seam, deeper picker/card
   bases, and domain modules in place of the root helper junk drawer
   ([#264](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/264)).
3. Refining the Editor skins from community feedback rounds. The five concrete
   skins now have guarded per-skin modules so visual work stays local while
   behavior remains shared. The latest pass gives a right-docked analysis graph
   a balanced starting width and keeps mouse-driven card selection and focus in
   sync ([#266](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/266)); the module
   boundaries landed in
   [#264](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/264), and earlier rounds
   covered the Soft pastel rework, dark-mode state contrast, the compact
   analysis panel, the modern GraphicEQ card, the insertion contract, and the
   skinned Device Selector ([#172](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/172)).
   Clarity and Graphite Clarity now give both Modern cards and Legacy Rows a
   high-readability dark/light choice: Graphite uses a charcoal control-room
   form, while Clarity prioritizes maximum contrast.
4. Phase and time. The analysis graph now switches between magnitude, phase and
   group delay, the all-pass filter has its own card and a 1st-order section,
   and `Delay` and the all-pass share a "Phase & Time" group in the picker. An
   all-pass changes nothing about level, so a magnitude-only graph could never
   show one ([#228](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/issues/228),
   [docs/features/phase-and-time.md](docs/features/phase-and-time.md)).
5. Editors for the programmatic config commands (`If:`/`ElseIf:`/`Else:`/`EndIf:`/`Eval:`) — complete. Each skin presents blocks with its own instrument driven by the analysis run, the picker inserts the vocabulary, custom-coefficient IIR lines have their own card, and lines with inline `` `expression` `` parameters keep their card in a dynamic mode ([#178](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/178), [#182](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/182), [#183](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/183), [#184](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/184)).
6. Subwoofer routing ([#246](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/issues/246)) — the core feature set is complete: the `SubwooferRouting:` command, the MIT SubwooferRoutingCore DSP library, the standalone VST3 plugin, the 4.1 host-negotiation fix, the Editor card with a per-skin instrument in every skin, and the full editor dialog with both routing matrices and a response view. Remaining follow-ups: writing changes back to a linked profile file (the dialog currently converts the row to inline state), audition/solo overrides, Korean translations for the new strings, and a custom VST3 editor view (hosts show their generic parameter panel).
7. Explicit VST3 bus layouts ([#216](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/issues/216)) — the backend `VSTPlugin:` `Input`/`Output` syntax and deterministic host tests are complete, including asymmetric layouts, 4.1, strict failure passthrough, and quiet VST2 ignore semantics. The Qt Editor now carries Input/Output selectors beside the plugin name in every skin's own visual language, with a verdict lamp for the actually negotiated bus, VST2 lock/repair handling, and the legacy `StereoInput` migration ([#265](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/265)). The current round adds per-slot channel fill (`InputChannels`/`OutputChannels` place arbitrary config channels into the negotiated slots, untouched channels pass through) and plain Input/Output dropdowns in the legacy row ([#290](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/290)). The fill lists now have their editor in every skin: two rails inside the card with per-slot channel dropdowns that follow the line's `Channel:`/`Copy:` flow, a fold switch when both rails exist, and combo rows in the legacy presentation ([#292](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/292)).
8. ASIO ([#310](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/issues/310)) —
   merged ([#314](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/314)): the
   wrapper driver, the engine host process, the ring between them, the device
   records, the Device Selector options and the CI gate. Verified with a fake
   driver on CI and, on a Topping USB Audio Device, by registering the entry
   through the Device Selector and opening it the way a DAW does. Remaining:
   runs under more DAWs, and the x64 entry for x64 DAWs on ARM64 machines.
9. Recording devices ([#321](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/321)) -
   a field report of a microphone with neither the EQ nor a VST applied.
   The path is now measured on every build: a CI gate installs a virtual
   cable driver, registers the APO on its recording side through the
   Device Selector and checks that a recording app hears the configured
   preamp. Fixed along the way: a slot the Device Selector fills is
   registered for every processing mode of its direction, so voice-chat
   streams on mode-aware drivers get the EQ too. The "(experimental)" label
   is gone. Remaining: the report's own environment is unknown; the probes
   in [docs/features/capture.md](docs/features/capture.md) are what to run
   on it.
10. WASAPI exclusive mode ([#325](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/pull/325)) -
   an exclusive-mode stream never reaches an APO, so the ASIO wrapper
   learned a second kind of target: any Windows endpoint, opened in WASAPI
   exclusive mode, offered to ASIO applications from the endpoint's own row
   in the Device Selector. Measured on a virtual cable locally and on CI;
   the study, with the low-latency answer, is in
   [docs/architecture/wasapi-exclusive-study.md](docs/architecture/wasapi-exclusive-study.md).
   Remaining: hardware beyond the cable, and one entry that pairs a device's
   playback and recording endpoints.

## Features

- Double-precision internal audio processing for complex filter chains.
- Convolution, GraphicEQ, parametric EQ, VST2/VST3, and standard Equalizer APO filter support.
- ASIO: every ASIO driver appears in the Device Selector's playback and
  capture lists; ticking one registers a `<driver> (EQ APO XT)` entry that
  DAWs and other ASIO hosts pick, and the same `config.txt` applies. The
  engine runs in a separate host process started on demand, so nothing but a
  thin wrapper enters the application ([docs/features/asio.md](docs/features/asio.md)).
- MultiConvolution filter for true-stereo and BRIR (Binaural Room Impulse Response) playback: `MultiConvolution: L=0+1 R=2+3 brir.wav` convolves each channel's own signal with its mapped channels of one multichannel impulse response and sums them back, independent of the Channel command - the fan-out/sum pattern the in-place Convolution filter cannot express, in one line. Each mapped channel takes an optional factor with Copy's grammar (`L=0.5*0+1`; `-1` inverts the phase, `-6dB` works too). The Editor edits the mapping in every skin's routing view.
- A built-in 1025-tap linear-phase Hilbert transform with explicit phase-shift
  and latency-alignment roles. For example,
  `Hilbert: Shift=SL,SR Align=L,R Direction=-90` applies the selected ±90°
  transform to `SL,SR` and the matching 512-sample delay to `L,R`.
- A built-in sparse velvet-noise decorrelator. `Velvet: Mode=Dynamic` gives
  every channel an independent, unit-energy kernel and renews the kernels with
  an equal-power transition; Static mode and the amount, time spread, density,
  evolution, transition, decay, and deterministic variation are all explicit
  parameters. Frequency-response analysis freezes Dynamic mode to one labelled
  snapshot because a time-varying response has no single permanent curve.
  The independent, MIT-licensed
  [Dynamic Velvet Decorrelator VST3](https://github.com/115dkk/Velvet-Noise-Decorrelator-VST3)
  exposes the same portable DSP outside EqualizerAPO-XT.
- One-line subwoofer routing: `SubwooferRouting:` runs per-speaker-group
  crossovers, dedicated bass paths, preservation of the physical LFE input,
  per-path gain/polarity/delay/EQ and an output summing matrix from one JSON
  state (inline or a `*.swxt.json` profile), with automatic headroom and a
  built-in preset reproducing issue #246's original chain sample for sample.
  The same MIT-licensed DSP core also ships as the standalone
  `EAPO XT Subwoofer Routing` VST3 plugin, exchanging the identical JSON state.
- Native VST3 hosting through the Steinberg VST3 SDK (MIT-licensed pluginterfaces), with 64-bit (double) processing where the plug-in supports it. Channel layouts are negotiated from the actual channel names, so a 4.1 system negotiates as 4.1 instead of being mislabeled 5.0.
- Explicit asymmetric VST3 main buses through `VSTPlugin: Library "...\\Plugin.vst3" Input Stereo Output 7.1`. Input and output independently support Auto, Mono, Stereo, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 7.1.2, and 7.1.4; rejected VST3 contracts safely pass audio through instead of silently choosing another width, while VST2 ignores the layout keys. See the [configuration reference](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/wiki/Configuration-reference#vstplugin-bus-layouts).
- Portable SIMD kernels written once with [Google Highway](https://github.com/google/highway) and compiled per variant: SSE2, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, and AVX10.1 on x64, NEON on ARM64.
- Modernized Qt Editor: card-based filter UI and five fully differentiated visual skins — each with its own row chrome, knob rendering, and Copy routing renderer ([docs/skin-integration-report.md](docs/skin-integration-report.md)) — plus embedded fonts and high-DPI scaling.
- Automatic updates: the Editor downloads new releases in the background and applies them on exit. A standalone UpdateChecker tool provides notify-only checks.
- Auto-detect installer that picks the matching SIMD build for the local CPU and verifies the download against the release checksums before running it.
- AOCL-FFTW, libsndfile, muparserx, TCLAP, and Qt-based GUI tools.
- Shared VC++ runtime DLLs for better Windows compatibility.
- GitHub Actions pipeline for builds, tests, installers, and releases, plus a biweekly automated code audit that builds the tree and runs the test suites.

## Installation

Install from the [Releases page](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/releases). A push to `main` builds all supported variants and creates a GitHub Release with Velopack-packaged installers and a source code zip.

The recommended download is **EqualizerAPO-XT-Setup.exe**, an auto-detect installer. It detects your CPU (architecture and AVX level), downloads the matching build, shows the progress and the SHA-256 verification in its own window, and only launches a download that matches the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`. The per-channel `…-Setup.exe` files stay available for installing a specific build. See [docs/AutoDetectInstaller.md](docs/AutoDetectInstaller.md).

Releases are not code-signed yet, so Windows Defender/SmartScreen can flag a fresh download as unknown (reports have used the generic `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml` label - a reputation verdict on unsigned new files, not an actual analysis). Every asset can be checked against the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the auto-detect installer does this automatically before anything runs.

After installation the app appears in the Start menu and in Apps & Features
as **EQ APO XT** plus its instruction set: the baseline SSE2 build is just
"EQ APO XT", the others are "EQ APO XT AVX", "EQ APO XT AVX2",
"EQ APO XT AVX-512", "EQ APO XT AVX10" and "EQ APO XT Neon".

After installation the Editor keeps itself current: it downloads newer releases in the background and applies them when the Editor closes. The flow is documented in [docs/VelopackUpdates.md](docs/VelopackUpdates.md).

## Documentation

User documentation lives in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/115dkk/EqualizerAPO-XT/wiki) in English and Korean, synced from `Wiki/github-wiki/` in this repository. Developer notes live under [docs/](docs/), including the [branch and release workflow](docs/BranchWorkflow.md).

## Building

The project uses Visual Studio, Qt, Velopack, and a small set of external libraries. Running [setup-build.ps1](setup-build.ps1) provisions all of them for a local build (binary dependencies, header-only checkouts, and Qt 6.10.1). The manual layout is documented in [docs/LocalDependencySetup.md](docs/LocalDependencySetup.md).

The forked dependency repositories are:

- [AOCL-FFTW 5.1 / FFTW 3.3.10](https://github.com/thefirekahuna/amd-fftw)
- [muparserx 4.0.13](https://github.com/thefirekahuna/muparserx)
- [libsndfile 1.2.2](https://github.com/thefirekahuna/libsndfile)
- [tclap 1.2.5](https://github.com/thefirekahuna/tclap)

Two header-only dependencies are checked out rather than vendored: [Google Highway](https://github.com/google/highway) under `deps/highway` and the Steinberg [VST3 pluginterfaces](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3_pluginterfaces) under `deps/vst3sdk/pluginterfaces`.

By default, project files look for dependencies under the repo-local `deps/` directory:

- `deps/fftw`
- `deps/libsndfile`
- `deps/muparserx`
- `deps/tclap`
- `deps/highway`
- `deps/vst3sdk`

The same environment variables can override those defaults:

- `FFTW_INCLUDE`, `FFTW_LIB`
- `LIBSNDFILE_INCLUDE`, `LIBSNDFILE_LIB`
- `MUPARSERX_INCLUDE`, `MUPARSERX_LIB`
- `TCLAP_ROOT`
- `HIGHWAY_INCLUDE`
- `VST3_SDK`

The SIMD variant set is defined once in `.github/simd-variants.psd1`. That manifest drives the CI matrix, the pinned dependency downloads, the installer channel names, and the release notes. CI currently builds these variants:

- `windows-x64-sse2`
- `windows-x64-avx`
- `windows-x64-avx2`
- `windows-x64-avx512`
- `windows-x64-avx10_1`
- `windows-arm64`

Pull requests build only the primary `avx2` variant. Pushes to `main` build all six when the automatic version bump produces a new version; pushes that cannot produce a release (docs, CI, refactor-only changes) skip the build matrix. Manual `workflow_dispatch` runs always build all six. The SIMD matrix, dependency artifact names, installer artifact names, and test policy are tracked in [docs/SimdBuildMatrix.md](docs/SimdBuildMatrix.md).

Qt tools are built through qmake in CI and in the documented local setup. A full Visual Studio solution build also needs a working Qt VS Tools/QtMsBuild setup.

## Tests

`Tests/` holds seven projects: `EditorLogicTests` and `HybridConvTests` (unit tests), `EngineOrchestrationTests` (engine routing and config-swap behavior), `AudioRegressionTests` (engine output compared against committed references, also run across SIMD variants in CI), `TestVst2Plugin` / `TestVst3Plugin` (self-built plug-ins used to test the VST2 and VST3 hosts at runtime), and `VstPreviewProbe` (a manual console harness behind the `vst3-preview-probe` workflow that validates the plugin panel's live-audio preview premises on a real endpoint). Test policy per variant is part of [docs/SimdBuildMatrix.md](docs/SimdBuildMatrix.md).

## Special Thanks

- **Mephistos (DCinside)** - diagnosed why VST3 plugin panels showed no live meters or graphs in the Editor, built and shared a working WASAPI-loopback patch under the GPL, and provided the Open-XTC plugin used to verify the fix. The panel preview feed (`Editor/helpers/PanelPreviewFeeder`) is derived from that contribution.
