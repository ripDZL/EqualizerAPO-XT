.SYNOPSIS
    Fails when an engine source Common.vcxproj compiles is missing from
    Editor/Editor.pro.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Editor deliberately does not link Common.lib: it compiles the engine
    sources itself so the analysis panel's FilterEngine runs under the Editor's
    own SIMD flags (audit #146 TD013, maintainer decision 2026-07-04, recorded in
    Editor.pro). The price of that decision is one engine source list maintained
    by hand in two files, and the two have drifted before (d66a523, b7c04a4).

    The drift is asymmetric, which is what makes it expensive: MSBuild stays
    green, and only the qmake Editor build notices, twenty minutes into a matrix
    leg on the runner, at the link step. This lint runs before the matrix starts.

    Only the Common.vcxproj -> Editor.pro direction is an error. The reverse is
    normal: Editor.pro also reaches outside the Editor directory for helpers
    Common.vcxproj does not compile at all (WindowsServiceControl, ApoRegistration,
    AudioFormatProbe, services/update - shared with DeviceSelector), so a ../
    entry with no ClCompile behind it is not reported.

    It then checks that every source and header the test projects list actually
    exists. Those lists are hand-written too and nothing checked them: a renamed
    or moved file leaves a stale entry that only surfaces as a compiler error
    partway through a matrix leg.
