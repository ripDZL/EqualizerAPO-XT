Reuses the previous release's auto-detect installer when nothing that goes
into that binary has changed.

Why: EqualizerAPO-XT-Setup.exe is deliberately release-agnostic (it always
resolves /releases/latest), yet every release used to rebuild and upload a
byte-different copy. Defender/SmartScreen reputation is accumulated per file
hash, and an unsigned binary whose hash resets every release starts every
release at zero - the root of the Wacatac.B!ml false-positive reports. As
long as the installer's inputs are untouched, re-uploading the previous
release's exact bytes lets one hash keep collecting reputation.

The decision is deliberately conservative: any anomaly (no previous release,
missing asset, unfetchable tag, changed watch path) falls back to a fresh
build, which is always correct - just reputation-less.

version.h is intentionally NOT watched: it only stamps the version resource.
The repository slug lives in release/DistributionConfig.h, which is already a
watched release input. A reused binary therefore reports the version of the
release that last changed the installer - that is its real version.

Returns a pscustomobject: Reuse (bool), PreviousTag, Reason. On Reuse=true
the previous asset has been downloaded to OutputPath.
